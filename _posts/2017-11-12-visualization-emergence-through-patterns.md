# Visualization - emergence through patterns

In a kind of meta way, the [readings on visualization][0] lead to an emergence of their own, whose corpus (if I can appropriate the term to mean their aggregate) revealed a structure based on definition, design, patterns, and tools.

## Definition(s)

Perhaps one of my favourite short definitions was from Lev Manovich in "What is Visualization" where she writes,

> "Let's define information visualization as a mapping between discrete data and a visual representation."(p.23)

Going beyond the short to a more fulsome definition, there are a few more concepts that pop up however. The notion of the _[macroscope][1]_ is a great way of thinking of the role of visualizations because it engenders notions of seeing the big picture, and the possible connections that may become apparent as a result; connections that may have otherwise gone unseen. I once attended a workshop with [Edward Tufte][2] in Dallas, TX, and he talked about how our desire to communicate patterns through aggregation of data into visual representations has been around for a while as a way of bringing out big strategic concepts, thus allowing for tactical deep dives into specifics, anchored in the whole. This macroscopic view allows us to see patterns and interesting points of exploration.

## Patterns and emergence

The beauty of a good visualization lies in its ability to allow one to look for (and see) patterns within them. Whether it's [Mainard's Napoleon Map][3], or [Manovich's Equalogram Project][4], I find this to be the essence of visualization in practice. It's about allowing for the emergence of patterns that allow you to see connections between things that may not intuitively exist, yet once you see them they become obvious. It's a way of making the strange, familiar.

In my work with user experience (UX) design, visualizations such as [chord diagrams][5], [pietree diagrams][6], etc., tell us the _what_ which inform our research into the _how_ and the _why_. To expand on that a bit, the "how" informs in terms of how a user arrived at a certain conclusion about a choice for an interaction, while the "why" informs in terms of why a user chose one things versus another when trying to complete a task. In our analysis we look for correlative patterns, and the connections between interesting data points to look for insights that will ultimately inform further iterations in the design of a product and/or service.

## Design

In "[Principles of data visualization][7]", the issue is raised about the uses of data visualization in ways that may create a false sense of legitimacy about content that accompanies it. They write:

> "In a public world that values quantification so highly, visualizations may lend an air of legitimacy to a piece of research which it may or may not deserve. We will not comment on the ethical implications of such visualizations, but we do note that such visualizations are increasingly common and seem to play a role in successfully passing peer review, receiving funding, or catching the public eye." (Paragraph 18)

I am curious as to whether the current trend towards eschewing long-form content in favour of shorter pieces has helped with this rise in popularity and effectiveness for visualizations to aid in convincing audiences of a certain point of view, given that they display things in more easily recognizable patterns, which then allow audiences to engage with the accompanying content with a bias towards what they feel they already know from looking at the visualization? In this way, the danger is that it can become rather circular, in that the content supports the visualization, which supports the content, and so on.
