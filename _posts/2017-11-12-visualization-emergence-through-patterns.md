In a kind of meta way, the [readings on visualization][0] lead to an emergence of their own, whose corpus (if I can appropriate the term to mean their aggregate) revealed a structure based on definition, design, patterns, and tools.

## Definition(s)

Perhaps one of my favourite definitions was from Lev Manovich in "What is Visualization" where she writes,

> "Let's define information visualization as a mapping between discrete data and a visual representation."(p.23)
