# Finding meaning, making meaning

In anthropology we often speak of the notion of webs of significance or webs of meaning. In essence, an mostly according to anthropologist Clifford Geertz, we all belong to different webs of meaning that we are part of constructing and upholding. Text analysis is like looking for those webs in individual or corpuses (sp?) of text. 

In the readings for this section, I actually saw a couple of connections with code (the topic of our last section), most notably in Rockwell's article, "What is Text Analysis, Really?", when he writes about the creation of new texts as a result of the re-ordering of old ones to fit new narratives. The example he used was the bible, but I likened this to new programming languages, essentially taking parts of older and more established languages, and reconfiguring them to make new ones. With the advent of new text analysis tools, it is increasingly easier to find new ways of looking at texts and seeing patterns emerge that would otherwise be missed.

Another interesting phenomenon that arises from this, is that as content becomes increasingly digitized, with new content pretty much by default, there is a real interoperability to it, which makes it easier and easier to analyze with better and better tools.
